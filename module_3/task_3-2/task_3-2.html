          An infinite loop is a never-ending loop: The code keeps running because the conditions are never met. 
          In this case, it is possible to create an infinite loop within the condition of the while loop. 
          This is because

2. 
In part 2, can we create what is known as an "infinite" loop within the condition of the "while" loop?
Describe what would or would not be necessary to achieve this. 
Provide a thorough explanation of your answer.

3. 
Discuss briefly how quickly or slowly a computer might be able to compute this, considering the
number of guesses and the time it takes. How does the program behave while it is guessing? Can
the program perform other tasks concurrently?

4. 
Explain the relationship between rows and columns in nested "for" loops. Can we, for instance,
change the order, considering rows to be innermost or columns to be innermost, or does this not
matter?
