      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>
        When wake-up time is not 7, the If statement will not print out the text "I can the the bus to school".  
        When wake-up time is exactly 7, the If statement will print out this text. This is because the condition is met.
      </p>
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behavior of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>
        In part 2 there's an If else statement. When wake-up time is not 7, the else statement prints out the text "I'll have to take the car to school". 
        This is because the first condition (the if statement) is not met. 
        When wake-up time is exactly 7, the if statement is met, and the text will say "I can take the bus to school". 
      </p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>
        In part 3 we have an If, else and else-if statement. 
        When wake-up time is less than 7 or greater than 8, the else statement prints out "I'll have to take the car to school". 
        This is because neither the first condition of wake-up time being exactly 7 (the if statement) nor the second condition of wake-up time being exactly 8 (the else-if statement) is met. 
      </p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>
        If the number is exactly 0, the first two conditions are not met, which means that the printed text will be "Value is Zero". 
        Only when the two conditions are met will the printed text be either Positive or Negative.
        <br>Zero is neither positive nor negative.</br>
