      <li>Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?</li>
      <p>OOP is important because it makes the code sustainable, meaning it can be reused in the same or other projects, it's easier to maintain and manage because it's separates the code into pieces. OOP also allows for encapsulation, which keeps the code safer and reduces unintended data corruption.</p><br>

      <li>In Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and how this type of object can help us in software development.</li>
      <p>
        It's used for 
      </p><br>

      <li>Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class</li>
      <p>We use encapsulation in classes to create an internal logic where code outside the class won't be interrupted when creating new instances inside the class. This makes the code safer and reduces bugs.</p><br>

      <li>Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function.</li>
      <p>Public members in a constructor function are the default members of a constructor function. They are created by using the keyword "this" inside the constructor. Private members created by assigning them to a variable (let og const) inside the constructor.</p><br>

      <li>Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript.</li>
      <p>Wen we use the "new" command in JavaScript, we call a constructor function to create new object instances of the class we defined.</p><br>
