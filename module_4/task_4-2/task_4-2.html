      <li>What is an array? A short and concise answer is expected here!</li>
      <p>An array is a container for multiple values, which can be stored in a variable.</p><br>

      <li>What does it mean to "hardcode" when we talk about programming? (In English, it's called "hardcoding", "hard-coding", or "hardcoding").</li>
      <p>To hardcode means that values are written directly into the statement (the source code), instead of using variables or other data types. Hardcoding makes the program harder to maintain and reuse at a later time.</p><br>

      <li>Explain in plain text what happens in task 3, and how we can traverse (iterate) the array when we(humans) don't "know" how long the array is.</li>
      <p>The forEach() method iterates through every single word separated by space in the array, while the forEach function prints out these words.</p><br>

      <li>Why is it beneficial to store instances of a class in arrays, as in task 4?</li>
      <p>It's beneficial because we can store the large amount of data in one variable, on a simple line of code, instead of making multiple lines of code using different variables.</p><br>

      <li>Try your best to explain the EWeekDays object from task 7. How do we use the "value" attribute, for example? In what way do "WeekDay", "Workdays", and "Weekends" differ from each other? If we wanted to create a new element "WorkoutDays", which would contain "Monday", "Wednesday", and "Thursday", how would it ideally look? (I will choose the best answer to this task and reward it with pizza in the cafeteria right after New Year. Remember to mark in your submission if you want to participate in the competition!)</li>
      <p>
        (...)
      </p><br>
      
      <li>In task 8, we will use a "callback" routine when sorting. Explain how such a "callback" routine works</li>
      <p>In a callback routine, you first pass the callback function as an argument to another function and then later call it inside that function.</p><br>

      <li>What happens in the sorting routines you have created? Try to explain how the array can figure out if an element should come before or after another. The best way to answer this is to actually print both parameters each time the sorting routine runs.</li>
      <p>The "sortRandomNumbers" function is used as a callback function for randomNumbers.sort(sortRandomNumbers). .sort() sorts the elements of the "randomNumbers" array, meaning it sorts the elements as strings in ascending order, while .reverse() sorts the elements in descending order.<br>
      The callback function tells the array which element comes before another by comparing value1 with value2. If the return is negative, then value1 comes before value2. And if the return is positive, then value2 comes before value1. If the return is equal (0) then the order is not changed.</p><br>

      <li>In task 10, we will create an array with rows and columns. Explain what the first element of the array contains.</li>
      <p>The first element of the array contains 9 strings, which is the first row of the array table.</p><br>
